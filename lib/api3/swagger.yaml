  description:
    Nightscout API v3 is a component of cgm-remote-monitor project. It aims to provide lightweight, secured and HTTP REST compliant interface for your T1D treatment data exchange.


    API v3 uses these environment variables, among other things&#58;

    - Security switch (optional, default = `true`)
    <pre>API3_SECURITY_ENABLE=true</pre>
    You can turn the whole security mechanism off, e.g. for debugging or development purposes,
    but this should never be set to false in production.


    - Number of minutes of acceptable time skew between client's and server's clock (optional, default = 5)
    <pre>API3_TIME_SKEW_TOLERANCE=5</pre>
    This security parameter is used for preventing anti-replay attacks, specifically when checking the time from `Date` header.


    - Maximum limit count of documents retrieved from single query
      <pre>API3_MAX_LIMIT=1000</pre>


    - Autopruning of obsolete documents (optional, default is only `DEVICESTATUS`=60)
      <pre>API3_AUTOPRUNE_DEVICESTATUS=60

      API3_AUTOPRUNE_ENTRIES=365

      API3_AUTOPRUNE_TREATMENTS=120
      </pre>
      You can specify for which collections autopruning will be activated and length of retention period in days, e.g. "Hold 60 days of devicestatus, automatically delete older documents, hold 365 days of treatments and entries, automatically delete older documents."


    - Fallback deduplication switch (optional, default = true)
      <pre>API3_DEDUP_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true</pre>
      API3 uses the `identifier` field for document identification and mutual distinction within a single collection. There is automatic deduplication implemented matching the equal `identifier` field. E.g. `CREATE` operation for document having the same `identifier` as another one existing in the database is automatically transformed into `UPDATE` operation of the document found in the database.

      Documents not created via API v3 usually does not have any `identifier` field, but we would like to have some form of deduplication for them, too. This fallback deduplication is turned on by having set `API3_DEDUP_FALLBACK_ENABLED` to `true`.
      When searching the collection in database, the document is found to be a duplicate only when either he has equal `identifier` or he has no `identifier` and meets&#58;
      <pre>`devicestatus` collection&#58; equal combination of `created_at` and `device`

      `entries` collection&#58;      equal combination of `date` and `type`

      `food` collection&#58;         equal `created_at`

      `profile` collection&#58;      equal `created_at`

      `treatments` collection&#58;   equal combination of `created_at` and `eventType`
      </pre>


    - Fallback switch for adding `created_at` field along the `date` field (optional, default = true)
      <pre>API3_CREATED_AT_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true</pre>
      Standard APIv3 document model uses only `date` field for storing a timestamp of the event recorded by the document. But there is a fallback option to fill `created_at` field as well automatically on each insert/update, just to keep all older components working.

      description: General search operation through documents of one collection, matching the specified filtering criteria. You can apply&#58;


        1) filtering - combining any number of filtering parameters


        2) ordering - using `sort` or `sort$desc` parameter


        3) paging - using `limit` and `skip` parameters


        When there is no document matching the filtering criteria, HTTP status 204 is returned with empty response content. Otherwise HTTP 200 code is returned with JSON array of matching documents as a response content.


        This operation requires `read` permission for the API and the collection (e.g. `*:*:read`, `api:*:read`, `*:treatments:read`, `api:treatments:read`).


        The only exception is the `settings` collection which requires `admin` permission (`api:settings:admin`), because the settings of each application should be isolated and kept secret. You need to know the concrete identifier to access the app's settings.

      summary: 'CREATE: Inserts a new document into the collection'
      description:
        Using this operation you can insert new documents into collection. Normally the operation ends with 201 HTTP status code, `Last-Modified` and `Location` headers specified and with an empty response content. `identifier` can be parsed from the `Location` response header.


        When the document to post is marked as a duplicate (using rules described at `API3_DEDUP_FALLBACK_ENABLED` switch), the update operation takes place instead of inserting. In this case the original document in the collection is found and it gets updated by the actual operation POST body. Finally the operation ends with 204 HTTP status code along with `Last-Modified` and correct `Location` headers.


        This operation provides autopruning of the collection (if autopruning is enabled).


        This operation requires `create` (and/or `update` for deduplication) permission for the API and the collection (e.g. `api:treatments:create` and `api:treatments:update`)

        Basically this operation looks for a document matching the `identifier` field returning 200 or 404 HTTP status code.


        If the document has been found in the collection but it had already been deleted, 410 HTTP status code with empty response content is to be returned.


        When `If-Modified-Since` header is used and its value is greater than the timestamp of the document in the collection, 304 HTTP status code with empty response content is returned. It means that the document has not been modified on server since the last retrieval to client side.
        With `If-Modified-Since` header and less or equal timestamp `srvModified` a normal 200 HTTP status with full response is returned.

        If the document has been found in the collection but it had already been deleted, 410 HTTP status code with empty response content is to be returned.


        When no document with `identifier` has been found in the collection, then an insert operation takes place instead of updating. Finally 201 HTTP status code is returned with only `Last-Modified` header (`identifier` is already known from the path parameter).


        You can also specify `If-Unmodified-Since` request header including your timestamp of document's last modification. If the document has been modified by somebody else on the server afterwards (and you do not know about it), the 412 HTTP status code is returned cancelling the update operation.

        HISTORY operation is intended for continuous data synchronization with other systems.

        Every insertion, update and deletion will be included in the resulting JSON array of documents (since timestamp in `Last-Modified` request header value). All changes are listed chronologically in response with 200 HTTP status code. The maximum listed `srvModified` timestamp is also stored in `Last-Modified` and `ETag` response headers that you can use for future, directly following synchronization. You can also limit the array's length using `limit` parameter.


        Deleted documents will appear with `isValid` = `false` field.


        When there is no change detected since the timestamp the operation ends with 204 HTTP status code and empty response content.


        HISTORY operation has a fallback mechanism in place for documents, which were not created by API v3. For such documents `srvModified` is virtually assigned from the `date` field (for `entries` collection) or from the `created_at` field (for other collections).


        This operation requires `read` permission for the API and the collection (e.g. `api:treatments:read`)


        The only exception is the `settings` collection which requires `admin` permission (`api:settings:admin`), because the settings of each application should be isolated and kept secret. You need to know the concrete identifier to access the app's settings.

      description:
        LAST MODIFIED operation inspects collections separately (in parallel) and for each of them it finds the date of any last modification (insertion, update, deletion).

        Not only `srvModified`, but also `date` and `created_at` fields are inspected (as a fallback to previous API).


        This operation requires `read` permission for the API and the collections (e.g. `api:treatments:read`). For each collection the permission is checked separately, you will get timestamps only for those collections that you have access to.

      name: filter_parameters
      schema:
        type: string
      description:
        Any number of filtering operators.


        Each filtering operator has name like `<field-name>$<operator>`, e.g. `carbs$gt=2` which represents filtering rule "The field carbs must be present and greater than 2".


        You can choose from operators&#58;


        `eq`=equals, `insulin$eq=1.5`


        `ne`=not equals, `insulin$ne=1.5`


        `gt`=greater than, `carbs$gt=30`


        `gte`=greater than or equal, `carbs$gte=30`


        `lt`=less than, `carbs$lt=30`

        `nin`=not in specified set, `eventType$nin=Temp%20Basal|Temporary%20Target`


        `re`=regex pattern, `eventType$re=Temp.%2A`


        When filtering by field `date`, `created_at`, `srvModified` or `srvCreated`, you can choose from three input formats

        - Unix epoch in milliseconds (1525383610088)

        - Unix epoch in seconds (1525383610)

        - ISO 8601 with optional timezone ('2018-05-03T21:40:10.088Z' or '2018-05-03T23:40:10.088+02:00')


        The date is always queried in a normalized form - UTC with zero offset and with the correct format (1525383610088 for `date`, '2018-05-03T21:40:10.088Z' for `created_at`).

    lastModifiedRequiredHeader:
      in: header
      name: Last-Modified
      schema:
        type: string
      required: true
      description:

        &lt;day-name&gt;, &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;hour&gt;&#58;&lt;minute&gt;&#58;&lt;second&gt; GMT


            Example&#58;


            <pre>Last-Modified&#58; Wed, 17 Oct 2018 05&#58;13&#58;00 GMT</pre>


    ifModifiedSinceHeader:
      in: header
      name: If-Modified-Since
      schema:
        type: string
      required: false
      description:
          Timestamp (defined with respect to server's clock) of the last document modification formatted as&#58;


        &lt;day-name&gt;, &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;hour&gt;&#58;&lt;minute&gt;&#58;&lt;second&gt; GMT


            If this header is present, the operation will compare its value with the srvModified timestamp of the document at first and the operation result then may differ. The srvModified timestamp was defined by server's clock.


            Example&#58;


            <pre>If-Modified-Since&#58; Wed, 17 Oct 2018 05&#58;13&#58;00 GMT</pre>


    ifUnmodifiedSinceHeader:

            The client should not create the identifier, the server automatically assigns it when the document is inserted.


            The server calculates the identifier in such a way that duplicate records are automatically merged (deduplicating is made by `date`, `device` and `eventType` fields).


            The best practise for all applications is not to loose identifiers from received documents, but save them carefully for other consumer applications/systems.


            API v3 has a fallback mechanism in place, for documents without `identifier` field the `identifier` is set to internal `_id`, when reading or addressing these documents.

    Settings:
      description:
        A document representing persisted settings of some application or system (it could by Nightscout itself as well). This pack of options serves as a backup or as a shared centralized storage for multiple client instances. It is a probably good idea to `PATCH` the document instead of `UPDATE` operation, e.g. when changing one settings option in a client application.


        `identifier` represents a client application name here, e.g. `xdrip` or `aaps`.


        `Settings` collection has a more specific authorization required. For the `SEARCH` operation within this collection, you need an `admin` permission, such as `api:settings:admin`. The goal is to isolate individual client application settings.
